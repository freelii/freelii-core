Wallet Transfer Policy: Technical & Product Brief
Executive Summary
The Wallet Transfer Policy is a Soroban smart contract that enables frictionless transfers between pre-authorized wallets while maintaining cryptographic security. It eliminates the need for passkey confirmation on every transaction between trusted wallets (e.g., Main ‚Üí Personal ‚Üí Savings wallets) while preserving the security model of the underlying smart wallet infrastructure.

Storage Architecture
Instance Storage (Global):
Admin ‚Üí Address (contract administrator)
PolicySigners ‚Üí Map<Address, ()> (addresses that can receive from any authorized signer)
Persistent Storage (Per-Signer):
AuthorizedWallets(signer_pubkey) ‚Üí Map<Address, ()> (recipient addresses for each signer)

Integration Patterns
A. Asset Contract Integration:
Policy binds to specific asset contracts through SignerLimits
Each signer can have different asset permissions
Supports multiple assets per signer
B. Smart Wallet Integration:
Leverages passkey-kit infrastructure
Maintains compatibility with existing wallet ecosystem
Preserves passkey security for non-policy operations
C. Multi-Contract Architecture:

Performance & Scalability
Storage Efficiency:
Uses Map<Address, ()> instead of Set<Address> (Soroban SDK limitation)
Persistent storage for signer-specific data
Instance storage for global configuration
Gas Optimization:
Single storage read per authorization check
Minimal computational overhead
Early termination on validation failures
Concurrency Model:
Lock-free design (Soroban's built-in atomicity)
Parallel transaction processing supported
No shared mutable state between signers

üîí Security Model & Risk Assessment
Security Guarantees
‚úÖ What is Protected:
Only transfer operations allowed (no arbitrary contract calls)
Explicit recipient authorization (no wildcard permissions)
Admin-controlled authorization matrix
Cryptographic signer validation
Single-operation validation (prevents batch attacks)
‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations:
Admin Key Security: Admin compromise = policy compromise
Signer Key Security: Individual signer compromise = authorized transfers only
Smart Wallet Dependency: Policy inherits smart wallet security model
Attack Vector Analysis
1. Malicious Admin:
Risk: Could authorize unauthorized recipients
Mitigation: Multi-sig admin, governance model, time delays
2. Compromised Signer:
Risk: Transfers to authorized recipients only
Impact: Limited to pre-approved addresses
Mitigation: Regular authorization review, spending limits
3. Policy Contract Bugs:
Risk: Incorrect validation logic
Mitigation: Comprehensive testing, formal verification, audits
Compliance & Auditing
Audit Trail:
All authorization changes logged on-chain
Transaction history immutable
Admin actions traceable
Regulatory Considerations:
KYC/AML: Authorized recipients can be pre-verified
Tax Reporting: Clear transaction categorization
Data Privacy: No PII stored on-chain
