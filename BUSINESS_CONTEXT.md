# Freelii — Business & Product Overview

## What is Freelii?

Freelii is a non-custodial crypto wallet built on the Stellar blockchain, designed to enable **remittances, P2P payments, and DeFi access** through messaging platforms like **Viber and Telegram**. It rebrands and expands on the original project, **Strooper Wallet**, introducing a B2B2C model focused on **financial inclusion** in underbanked markets like the Philippines and Mexico.

Freelii combines advanced blockchain capabilities (like Stellar's PassKey support and Soroban smart contracts) with a familiar user experience via **chatbot UIs** inside social platforms. The wallet allows users to onboard without needing to understand crypto complexities—unlocking global financial services in a simple, secure, and localized way.
